                $GRC reflection advantages:
            </h3>

                The reflection mechanism is decentralised and trustless as it's managed by a smart contract that
                 automatically distributes tokens across the wallets of all holders, a liquidity pool, and a burn wallet.
                 All that holders have to do is 'hold and earn', and ensure they manage their wallets carefully.</br></br>
                 The whole process is transparent 
                 as every wallet that receives a part of the fee can be publicly audited on the blockchain</br></br>
                 The hold and earn funtionality offers users the benefit to earn yield without having to stake their tokens,
                  while addressing the issue of excessive price movements and selling pressure. Some more key issues it addresses are:</br></br>
                  ✅️No staking</br> 
                  ✅️DeFi yield generation</br> 
                  ✅️Security is ensured through the smart contract</br> 
                  ✅️Fair distribution of earned tokens</br></br>
                  The mechanism of reflection tokens increases the number of ways investors can earn in DeFi
                   as holders can earn rewards on
                   their tokens while using it for staking and other ways of earning passive income.</br></br>
                   ✅️The yield-generating token distribution process is easy, secure and transparent via the usage of smart contracts.
                    There's no central party or interface to claim fees as the whole process is automated.</br></br>
                    ✅️It can prevent the frequent occurrence of massive price dumps and whale manipulations in newer crypto projects to some degree.</br></br>
                    ✅️Reflection mechanisms produce automatic liquidity, hence reducing supply and increasing price valuation.</br></br>
                    ✅️The cryptocurrency market outlook can be quite volatile. When cryptcurrencies are experiencing
                     a significant downward trend during a bear market (now!),
                     reflection token holders have a clear advantage thanks to the passive hold and earn rewards.
