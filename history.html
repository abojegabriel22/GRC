        <h1 class="lines genesis">üéìHISTORY ABOUT $GRC</h1>
        <p class="space1 genesis">
            Historically, the currencies were backed by gold. Today, USD is no longer backed by gold.</br>
             The government can just print paper which is worthless. That's why USA has a $33 trillion debt.</br>
             The government is rich while the people are poor. People spend everyday working hard for USD paper.</br>
             And the people on top just print that paper and you work hard to survive. It's just insane. We need to bring back secure currencies.</br>
             That's why $GRC is special. All the altcoins are losing value, because they have no value.</br>
             $GRC is here to bring sanity to the world and change the game!

        </p>
        <h3 class="genesis">ü•áGold</h3>
        <p class="space1 genesis">
            Buying $GRC doesn't mean you are buying gold. We dedicate some funds to purchasing gold.</br>
             This is done for three reasons:</br></br>
             1. If something ever happens to blockchain, ONLY THEN you can exchnage coins for gold.</br></br>
             2. This is a security of a coin. We are now in bear market, so the price of the coin won't go down.</br>
              When we hit next bearmarket, many coins will lose their value. Our coin is backed by gold.</br>
               So the price of the coin is less likely to go down, as people will know that the coin is secure.</br>
              If something ever happens, we have gold. Secure coin will continue to exist.<br><br>
              3. If the price ever drops too low and we would like to boost the coin price, we could consider selling off gold and buying $GRC coins.<br>
               This would be direct price intervention at the cost of developers. This is a safety option for dark times.
        </p>
        <h3 class="genesis">üéâ Presale</h3>
        <p class="space1 genesis">
            Presale will be a Fair Launch presale. The minimum generated funds required for launch will be only 1 BNB. However the fair launch will run for 15 days.<br>
             So we are expecting much more than that. The more $GRC coins people buy, the higher the price will be when we launch.<br>
             But that means we will generate a lot of liquidity and will be bullish, burning zeros! Presale will begin in the couple of days.<br><br>
             5 Billion $GRC will be available for presale. Another 5 billion will be used for liquidity. We will leave another 2 billion unlocked for development of the project.  
        </p>
        <h3 class="genesis">üîê Locking the other coins</h3>
        <p class="space1 genesis">
            The rest of coins - 88 billion coins will be locked and slowly unlocked for developers throughout 2 years.<br>
             Around 5 billion tokens will be unlocked by Whalepad.app every month. So we can never dump the price.<br><br>
             We will be releasing the unlocked tokens into circulation or selling them off to exchanges.  
        </p>
        <h3 class="genesis">‚ö†Ô∏è Scam/fud</h3>
        <p class="space1 genesis">
            I'm in charge of finance, so if something ever happens with the vesting coins, it will be only on me. <br><br>
            If we get whales and they dump the price, nothing I can do about it. It's an open market.
             But it happenned so many times with other coins, even Bitcoin. So don't be surprised.<br>
              But it isn't possible for me to rug pull you or scam, cos all the coins are locked.<br>
             And when they are unlocked, I will make sure it doesn't influence the price a lot. I won't put them into circulation straight away or sell them off at once.<br>
             As I said we will aim to sell them to exchanges, so the price continues to go up.<br><br>
             I will try my best to manage the development of this project, especially the financial part. I'm here to help those who want to acheive financial freedom.
